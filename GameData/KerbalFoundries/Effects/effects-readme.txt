The .kfx files in this folder are simply Unity Asset Bundles containing particle effect prefabs.

They are loaded by code in KSPWheel when referenced in a part config in the EFFECTS node, using
a specialized 'KSPWHEELFX' effect type.  The only known uses of this are in the Kerbal Foundries
repulsor and APU parts.
